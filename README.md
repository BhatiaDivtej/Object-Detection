Once the detector outputs a large number of bounding boxes, it is necessary to filter out the best ones. NMS is the most commonly used algorithm for this task. Typically, NMS filters proposals according to the IOU between the bounding boxes.

Evaluation Metrics
Positive: the network predicts that the box contains an object.
Precision: Measure the percentage that the predictions are correct.
Recall: Measure the percentage that the network successfully predict the ground truth.
